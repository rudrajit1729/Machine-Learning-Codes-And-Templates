# Classification

Welcome to Part 2 - Classification!

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. 
There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing.
Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:

1. Logistic Regression

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. Kernel SVM

5. Naive Bayes

6. Decision Tree Classification

7. Random Forest Classification
